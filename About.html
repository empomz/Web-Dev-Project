		Welcome to the about page of my website!

		My name is Cole Myers and I'm going into my third year here at KSU. I have experiences working on research projects here at KSU. My most notable contributions were to a project called "A Smart Illicit Water Discharge Monitoring System." We worked on developing a system that could remotely detection water contaminants and report it back to us. I worked mostly on the Python coding and machine learning for this project but I also did field work as well.
