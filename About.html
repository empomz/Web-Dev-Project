		Welcome to the about page of my website!
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a website made in my Intro to Web Development class, IT3203. This is a semester long project that is focused on teaching students how to build a website. I've tried to go for a dark theme for the website as I generally like those better myself, but I have more changes to make to make it perfect.
